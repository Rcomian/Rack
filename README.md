# Experiment - FPS limiting

An extra toolbar button lets you limit how many frames are rendered for the rack UI every second. This might help alleviate some kinds of CPU issues, especially on older macbooks.

Various options are available from 144 down to 1 frame per second.
At 1fps, the UI is unusable and will automatically switch to 10fps when you press the FPS button again.
