# Experiment - append-patch

Append an existing patch below your current patch.

Lets you build a library of components and compose them together.

Use the folder with a plus icon to access the append menu.
You can append a whole patch, or skip the first row of the patch you're appending.

The skip first row feature lets you build a component with audio and test trigger modules in the first row that don't get added to the combined patch when you append it.
