# Experiment - multi-threading

Make the existing engine multi-threaded.
Use the rocket ship icon to choose how many threads you want to use.

# Experiment - FPS limiting

An extra toolbar button lets you limit how many frames are rendered for the rack UI every second. This might help alleviate some kinds of CPU issues, especially on older macbooks.

Various options are available from 144 down to 1 frame per second.
At 1fps, the UI is unusable and will automatically switch to 10fps when you press the FPS button again.

# Experiment - module pushing

Holding shift while moving a module left or right will push any other modules it hits out of the way.
This lets you push a bunch of modules together to easily make space for another module.

# Free Rack
